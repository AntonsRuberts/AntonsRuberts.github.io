Who doesn't have a good story about a time when the tracking broke down and conversions went to 0 for about a week before anyone noticed? In this case you lose a lot of precious data but it can be much worse. For example, let's say your "Add to Cart" link is broken and the actual sales go down, or the discount code reduces the price to 0% and the sales sky-rocket for some reason. These technical issues have a real impact on business and can be quite costly. While an analyst will easily see where the problem has occured just by looking at the graph, he/she can't possible monitor all the metrics available. Wouldn't it be nice, if there was a way to automatically detect these abnormalities in your time-series data? Well, you're in luck! Today, I'll walk you through 6 of these techniques, and I'll compare them on a few benchmark datasets.
