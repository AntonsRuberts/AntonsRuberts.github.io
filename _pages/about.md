Hi all! My name is Antons, I'm a Data Scientist with 2 years of experience in applying machine learning in marketing analytics and fraud detection domains. My passion is with machine learning methods that are practical and can be used to deliver real value to the business. With these blogs I'm hoping to share some of the most interesting methodologies that I've come across, and help you understand them theoretically and practically. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" is the phrase that I strongly belive into, so you'll find simple, intuitive explanaitions in these blogs. Welcome to the Well Enough blog.
